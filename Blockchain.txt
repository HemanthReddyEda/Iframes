core concepts of block chain:
-----------------------------
	1.digital ledger technology(dlt):
		-when we perform a transaction records called blocks.they 		will stored in a linear chain.each block will link to the 		previous blocks using cryptography hashes.this chain is 		called a ledger and is distributes across the network of 		computers known as nodes.so that no single entity has 			control over the entire chain.

	2.decentralization:
		-instead of stored in central database,the block chain is 		replicated across many nodes in the network.
		-it ensures that there is no point of failure.even a node 		get failed or compromised, the network continues to 			function.

	3.security and immutability:
		-cryptographic hashing:
			->each block contains the hashcode,timestamp and 			  transaction data of the previous block.as hashing 			  used it creates a unique digital fingerprint for 			  the data and it is exteremly difficult to alter 			  the data.
		-consensus mechanism:
			->nodes in the network must agree on the validity 			of new blocks through consensus mechanisms like 			proof of work(PoW).or proof of stake(PoS).
				>>PoW: computers compete to solve complex 				mathematical puzzles.this process requires 				a lot of computational power and energy.
				>>PoS:in pos validators are choosen to 					create new blocks based on the number of 				cryptocurrency tokens they hold.the more 				tokens a validator stakes the higher their 				chance to add the nxt block to the 					blockchain.
		-immutability:
			->once a block is added to the network it is 				impossible to alter the data.because change would 			require in all the subsequent blocks.

How Blockchain Works:
----------------------
	1.Transaction Initiation:
		-A user requests a transaction,which is then broadcast to 		the network of nodes.
	2.Verification:
		-the network of nodes validates the transaction using 			algorithms and consensus mechanism.nodes check that the 		transaction is legitimate and that the user has the 			necessary assets.
	3.Block Creation:
		-once verified the transaction is combined with other 			transactions to form a new block.this block is then added 		to the blockchain.
	4.Hashing and linking:
		-the new block contains a hash of the previous block.this 		linking ensures the integrity of the entire blockchain.
	5.consensus and propagation:
		-nodes in the network reach consensus on the new blocks 		validity.once consensus is achived,the block is added to 		each nodes copy of the blockchain,a nd the transaction is 		complete.

Advantages of Blockchain:
-------------------------
	1.Transparency and Trust:
		-all transactions are recorded on a public ledger,making it 		easy to track and verify them.
	2.Security:
	3.Decentralization:
	4.Efficiency and Speed:
		-Blockchain can streamline processes and reduce the need 		for intermediaries,making transactions faster and more 			cost-effective.

Applications of Blockchain:
---------------------------
	1.Cryptocurrencies.
	2.Smart Contracts.
	3.Supply Chain Management.
	4.Voting Systems.
	5.Health care.

Questions on Blockchain:
------------------------
	1.What is a smart contract?
	->smart contract is a lines of code.that automatically execute the 	terms and conditions of an agreement when predefined conditions are 	met.

	2.What steps are involved in implementing smart contracts for land 	  registration?
	->1.designing a smart contract architecture.
	->2.Digitizing land records and migrating them to the block chain.
	->3.Developing a user interface for the users.

	3.Infrastructure required to support blockchain based land 		  registration?
	->requires a blockchain platform like Ethereum or 	Hyperledger,digital storage solutions,user interface to interact 	with block chain,secure communication networks,and cubersecurity 	measures.

	4.Further enhancements?
	->integration with IoT devices for real-time property monitoring 	could further enhance land registration.
	
	5.Difference between public and private block chain.
	->A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain where anyone 	can join the network and participate in the consensus process.
	->A private blockchain is permissioned,only selected entities can 	join the network,making it more cemtralized than public blockchains
	
	6.What is consensus mechanism?
	->it is a process used by blockchain netwroks to achieve an 	agreement from the blocks to add the new block.
	->common consensus mechanisms are Pow,Pos,Delegated PoS(DPoS).

	7.Can blockchain be hacked?
	->blockchain itself is a highly secured due to its decentralized 	nature and cryptographic principles.but individual enities like 	smart contracts or wallets can be vulnerable to hacking if not 	properly secured.
	
	8.what is blockchain fork?
	->A fork in blockchain is a situation where the blockchain diverges 	into two separate paths due to changes in protocol rules.
	->forks can be categorized as hard forks(permanent divergence) or 	soft forks(temporary divergence).

Smart contracts related questions:
----------------------------------
1.smart contracts for land registration?
->ownership and transfer management
->land title verification
->Transaction History

2.Solidity language is used to write the smart contracts.

3.remix ide and truffle suite is used to write and develop the smart contracts.

4.solidity is similar some what to java.it supports oops concepts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage of Ganache and Metamask:
-----------------------------
1.Metamask is a wallet provider, it is a browser extension, and transaction signer.
2.Ganache is used to create a local blockchain network.
	->it provides personal etherum blockchain for development and 	testing.
	->it is fast and lightweight making it ideal for rapid development 	iterations.
3.Metamask is used to sign transactions when deploying smart contracts to ganache or interacting with them during development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truffle compile and Truffle migrate commands:
---------------------------------------------
1.truffle compile:
	->compiles solidity smart contracts.
	->checks syntax,generates bytecode, and creates json artifacts.
	->ensures contracts are in a deployable state.
2.truffle migrate:
	->deploys compiled contracts to Ethereum blockchain.
	->executes migration scripts to manage deployment tasks.
